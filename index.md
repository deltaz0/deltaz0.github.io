I am a recent graduate (July '24) -- **currently residing in Denver, CO** -- from the University of North Texas in Denton, TX, from which I also hold a BS and MS in computer science. My dissertation topic explored the intersection of convolutional neural networks and non-lexical audio (music & sound effects).<br>Through my graduate career I have worked primarily in the [Laboratory for Recreational Computing](https://larc.unt.edu/) and the [xREZ Art+Science Lab](https://cvad.unt.edu/design/xrez-art-science-lab), with a focus in game programming, machine learning, and audio-focused DSP.

I maintain this page as a personal website and portfolio for a variety of my projects, research or otherwise, as well as my music.

My current goal is to apply the broad skillset I've gained throughout my research in game programming, digital audio simulation & synthesis, immersive analytics, machine learning, DSP, meshing, experimental HCI, psychoacoustics, audiation, and VR psychology into a position in industry.

I also produce digital audio, with a focus in electronic music, under the name [Delta Z](http://www.soundcloud.com/delta-z).

Recruiters: I am currently open to work **on-site/hybrid near Denver, CO**, or **remotely anywhere**. See my [CV](/cv).

Collaborators (art/production): I am open to contributing to the right project. I have developed and exhibited several installations (MOFO art festival; SIGGRAPH; ERVR) working from the engineering side, where I prioritize a clean user experience through ground-up optimization.
