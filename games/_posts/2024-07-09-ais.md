Projected full-body interactive data exploration tool with autostereographic virtual environment rendering the Global Ocean Survey (GOS) dataset. I was a contributor to this project after a large part of it was lost by the previous team. I restored and updated the project, including building a new control scheme from scratch using a custom IR camera OpenCV multiuser body tracking interface. I went on to oversee the exhibition of the reworked project as an installation at several museums and conferences.
