Multiplayer VR art-science data exploration system, exhibited at several museums & conferences. Utilizing night sky data collected from antarctic telescope combined with web-scraped metadata extensions from multiple sources, provides a VR interface where users are placed inside the cloud of astronomical bodies and can explore millions of data points through manual manipulation of any individual point. Doing so allows users to drill down to all available metadata about each point, while procedurally generating a unique audio-visual component which can be activated as part of a collaborative composition with other players.
