[Github Repo](https://github.com/deltaz0/SoundFlight) - Presented as-is from snapshot of (quite old) project status. Not representative of release code; not maintained.

A 3D rhythm game wherein a music track is split into stems which can be activated by a player one by one, with the goal of keeping the full composition going. The stems are on individual lanes the player can move between, and activated by moving a flying ship along notes procedurally placed on these lanes using a peak detection algorithm.
