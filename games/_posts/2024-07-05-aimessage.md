[Github Repo](https://github.com/deltaz0/AIMessage) - Presented as-is from snapshot of (quite old) project status -- this does not represent release code and is not maintained.

Primarily Android targeted (with iOS and PC compatibilty) choice-based story game which takes place in a false phone interface with text messaging and social media applications. Characters will text the player at different intervals throughout the day/week. Elements are customized to player choices. Features a stat checking system that allows more complex interactions like deceit attempts. Stats are chosen by a “roommate matching” questionnaire at the beginning of the game and evolve over time. Utilizes Marmalade SDK for multiplatform support.
