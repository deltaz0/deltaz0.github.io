[Github Repo](https://github.com/deltaz0/WavRide) - Presented as-is from snapshot of (quite old) project status. Not representative of release code; not maintained.

Utilizing xAudio and positional audio tools, a 3D world simulation with no graphical interface at all meant to be explored purely through sound with interactable goals throughout. Part of a study I developed to test if humans are capable of navigating game worlds through audio.
