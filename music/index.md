### <center>[<strong>THIS PAGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION</strong>]<br>I recently graduated and am in the process of relocating and rebuilding this site from scratch with my newer work. Content below likely old or placeholder.</center>

You can find most of my music work on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/delta-z).

I produced the music for the kickstarter video for the OMNI, a gaming apparatus for use with the Oculus Rift developed by Virtuix, which you can find [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1944625487/omni-move-naturally-in-your-favorite-game).

<!-- I'm also part of a collaborative project called Dust Loop, which you can find [here](https://soundcloud.com/dust-loop). -->
